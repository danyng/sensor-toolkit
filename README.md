# sensor-toolkit

Sensor toolkit is a plug and play data collecting tool. Designed for designers and creative professionals to easily collect data of the surroundings without frustrating with electronics and programming. 

The toolkit consist of a set of sensor modules, raspberry pi local access point hub and the data visualizer that can be displayed on any device that is connected to OOCSI. OOCSI is a MQTT communication protocol designed by Mathias Funk to enable designers to design for connectivity. This communication protocol is used for the connectivity for this project.
